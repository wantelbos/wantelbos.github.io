Cold hard data on COVID-19 in the USA presented in shiny graphs.

<h3>USA Overview</h3> 
<p>COVID-19 in the USA on a logarithmic scale. A logarithmic scale will show exponential growth as a straight line.
The simulated curves are for reference and assume 100 Mil cases (~30% of population) and 1 Mil deaths (1% fatality rate).
The simulated curves were calibrated with the actual number of deaths as of Mar 22, 2020.

<p>Below is a closer look at the same data over the course of last week.</p>

<h3>Growth Rate</h3>
<p>The growth ratio below is based off the number of deaths. This is the ratio between the total # of deaths today versus yesterday.
Deaths are the most reliable statistic. The number of reported cases depends on how much testing is being done and are being
undercounted with varying degree.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
Testing is essential for bringing an outbreak under control. The graph below shows the percentage of tests that come back positive.
This is an indirect indicator whether there is sufficient testing being done. In countries that have the outbreak under control the
number of positives is about 5%. A higher positive test rate basically means that only the most severe/obvious cases are being tested
and that the testing will not be very effective in preventing further spread.

<h3>Results by State</h3>
Different States within the USA are impacted in different ways. The population density and local government response will impact
growth rates. The graph below shows the "Top Ten" US states with highest growth rates. Only states with more than 5 deaths as of
last week are included.
